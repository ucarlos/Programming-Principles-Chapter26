This repository contains solutions to some problems from Bjarne Stroustrup's Principles of Programming Using C++ (2014).
These solutions were written on a Linux machine, but should work on Windows and macOS since it only uses the standard C++ library.

** Requirements
+ A C++ Compiler that supports C++17
+ CMake in order to build the project
  
** How to build
You can open this project in CLion and build it through the build option or you can do the following:

#+begin_src bash
  cmake .
  make # Or any other file created by cmake
