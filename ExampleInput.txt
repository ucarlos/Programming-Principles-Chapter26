Let’s try a simple experiment. Write a binary search. Do it now. Don’t wait until the end of the chapter. Don’t wait until after the next section. It’s important that you try. Now! A binary search is a search in a sorted sequence that starts at the middle: If the middle element is equal to what we are searching for, we are finished. If the middle element is less than what we are searching for, we look at the right-hand half, doing a binary search on that. If the middle element is greater than what we are searching for, we look at the left-hand half, doing a binary search on that. The result is an indicator of whether the search was successful and something that allows us to modify the element, if found, such as an index, a pointer, or an iterator.
